Note that JSR 166 provides facilities for asynchrony and we should decide if/how to integrate with these.

Sunil walked thru' his proposal briefly.

Roberto: What about Service/Server side asynchrony?

Sunil: This proposal only covers client side stuff as I thought
         EG agreed only client side asynchrony as the requirement.

Roberto: Lets deal with server side later then.

Roberto: It will be better to call 'close' on AsyncResponse as 'cancel' - to be consistent with Future

Sunil: Shouldn't be a problem. We just  felt 'close' is more appropriate.

Roberto: There may be some Usability issues if the async method takes a java.utils.Properties as an additional argument. Could conflict with methods that already have this parameter type.

Sunil: Agrees. We can have a specialized class. Our initial proposal had something like AsyncInfo.

Manoj:  Instead of 2 async methods, we could make them just one.
 
Sunil:  Callback will be like Callback and Poll then. That will be very confusing as

Sunil:  Could have some bootstrapping issues as the  type-safe Callback has to be generated at runtime.

Roberto: Bootstrapping won't be an issue as the type-safe Callback interface will be generated by Tools even in the dynamic proxy case just as SEI.

Roberto: Manoj’s Option 2 seems complex and meant for sophisticated users.

Manoj:  Not type safe callback/poll handlers in Sunil's proposal is problem for us.

Roberto: What happens if getAsyncResponse() is called before response is actually realized
     Manoj: Will block until it is realized.
     Sunil:  Will throw an exception
     Roberto: May be we should block like JSR 166's Future.get

Sunil: What is the status of JSR 166 and is it going to be included in j2se 1.5

Roberto: Yes, it will be part of j2se 1.5 and I believe it is in community or public draft.
 
Roberto: Why is replyTo needed for R-R case'?
 Sunil:   Though replyTo may be needed for R-R case, it should be done transparently by runtime and user should not procide it.
 Roberto: I agree
 Manoj:  To reflect WSDL bindings
             [I didn't fully get what Manoj said here].
 Roberto: I don't see a use case
